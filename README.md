DeltaDB is an offline-first database designed to talk directly to clients and works great offline and online.


Live Demos
---

* [todomvc-angular](http://delta-db.github.io/deltadb/examples/todomvc-angular) - a todo app. For fun, open it in 2 different browser windows and watch the todos change in the 2nd window when you change the todos in the 1st window.

* [hello](http://codepen.io/redgeoff/pen/vLKYzN?editors=100) - a simple hello world example with code

Main Principles
---

* Written in JavaScript
* Framework agnostic
* Works the same whether the client is offline or online
* NoSQL database that works in your browser and automatically syncs with the database cluster
* Stores all data as a series of deltas, which allows for smooth collaborative experiences even in frequently offline scenarios.
* Uses a simple last-write-wins conflict resolution policy and is eventually consistent
* Uses a homegrown ORM to speak to underlying SQL databases. (Support for underlying NoSQL databases will be added)
* Is fast. Clients push their deltas on to the server's queue. The server processes the queue separately and partitions the data so that clients can retrieve all recent changes very quickly.
* Implements a granular authentication system that protects databases, collections, docs and attributes
* Is incredibly scalable. Deltas can be segmented by UUID and the cost to add new nodes has a negligible impact on the cluster as handshaking between servers can be done as frequently as desired.
* Highly available. Clients can switch to talk to any node, even if that node hasn't received the latest deltas from another node.
* Fault tolerant by using the concept of a quorum of servers for recording changes
* Data is auto-restored when a client modifies data that was previously deleted
* Uses timestamps to update records so that transactions and their overhead can be avoided
* Thread-safe so that adding more cores will speed up DB reads and writes


Why?
---

Because it doesn't exist and true support for offline environments needs to be engineered from the ground up
- PouchDB relies on CouchDB and CouchDB is slow to replicate when there are many revisions and it is not optimized for offline setups like db-per-user
- Firebase doesn't work offline and is not open source
- Meteor doesn't work offline
